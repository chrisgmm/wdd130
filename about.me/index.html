    <p>Hello! My name is Chris Hoskin. I have a Bachelor's in Secondary Math Education. I am currently a High School math teacher/student council advisor. I'm excited to develop new skills this semester.
    I live in Las Vegas Nevada with my wonderful wife and hilarious kids. One of my favorie things at this point in life is goofing off with them (as seen above.)</p>
    <p>My favorite scripture comes from the war chapters. When the Nephites were surrounded and constantly under threat of attack. Working day and night to prepare to defend their homes.</p>
    <p>Alma 50:23 "But behold there never was a happier time among the people of Nephi, since the days of Nephi, than in the days of Moroni, yea, even at this time."</p>
    <p>I belive that even though times were scary and exhausting for the Nephites, they we happy because they knew they were doing exactly what the Lord would have them do. I hope I can do the same when I feel like I'm overwhelmed with worldly pressures.</p>
