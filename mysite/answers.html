        <p>If you’re an athlete, chances are you’ve been asked to spend some time in the weight room. Why? Is there any point in a game where someone throws 100 pounds of metal on your back and asks you to “get your legs parallel to the floor for two points!” Probably not.
            The reason your coach wants you in the weight room is because those exercises strengthen the muscles used to succeed in sports. Math is the same. Higher forms of thinking are born from the neural connections created by solving the kinds of problems math presents.</p>

      <div id="Paris" class="tabcontent">
        <h3>When?</h3>
        <img src="images/Bills.jpg" alt="When" class = "image">
        <p>Unfortunately, even with significant math skills, we still can’t predict with 100% certainty everything in store for you over the next 70 years or so. Suffice it to say, most jobs that haven’t been replaced by computers or machines will ask you to perform some sort of problem solving. Top-paying careers right outside of college include: Actuaries (insurance risk analysts), Statisticians (people that come up with the numbers on sports/money), Data Scientists (people that look for trends in events to make them more efficient.) Financial literacy (being good with money) is a must for a successful person. It could also be the key to a successful business too if you’re planning on being a boss in the future. 
            Although the silly “buy 43 watermelons for $3.14 a pound…” questions won’t occur too often; knowing how to use percentages, profits, budgeting, interest rates, salaries, benefits, etc will be greatly increased if you’re proficient in the basics of mathematics.</p>

        <h3>How?</h3>
        <img src = "images/hard_and_smart.jpg" alt="How" class = "image">
        <p>What skills does a successful person have? Most interviews show that successful people believe they can do difficult things. They have excellent memories, they can think creatively, and can cope well with failure. All of these skills have been shown to be closely-tied with math competency. 
            Once, I spoke to a septic tank cleaner (someone that cleans out all the solids that go down the toilet in areas outside of major cities.) He told me he was always told by his father, “people will value those who do what they can’t do, or what they don’t want to do.”
            He took the “what they don’t want to do” route (and became a millionaire.) Math gives you the skills for what others can’t and won’t do.</p>
