    <p>This website is for a student that has complained to their teacher about learning math. Students may be here out of curiosity or compulsorily via assignment from their teacher. Common questions are: “Why do I have to learn this?”, “When will I ever use this?”, and “How does this help me?” Links to the other pages will be seen below:
