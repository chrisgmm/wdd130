        <h1>Mastermind</h1>
    <div>
        A popular code-breaking game. The goal is to figure out the color-code by inputting a guess and looking at how many were in the right positions. This involves putting the known and unknown together in order to find a solution.

        <h1>Logic Puzzles</h1>
    <div>
        Once again, using what you do and donâ€™t know to figure out what is possible and what is not. Read the facts to start off, then induct and deduct what must be true because of those facts. This involves filling out a chart in order to help you pin down the solutions.

        <h1>KenKen</h1>
    <div>
        Somewhat numerical, but also filling in what must and must not be true. The grid must include one of every number that can fit in the row/column with no repeats. The operations surrounded by the bold outlines must also come together to create the small number in the corner. These are easy at first but get difficult quickly. Great way to work on if-then thinking.    </div>

        <h1>Khan Academy</h1>
    <div>
        A free website for videos on unkown concepts and live-feedback practice for those concepts.

     <section id = ixl-card>
        <img src="images/ixl.jpg" alt="IXL">
        <h1>IXL</h1>
    <div>
        Not free like Khan Academy, but the same basic idea. The difference is IXL has better videos and feedback for individual questions.
