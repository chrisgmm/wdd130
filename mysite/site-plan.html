      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The Purpose of this website is to have a quick response to a few common questions/complaints by High School Math Students. It will give them sussicnt and relatable responses to those questions as well as cite real work benefits to learning critical thinking skills/gowth mindset.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience is teenagers between the ages of 14-18. It will need to look striking/strange to hook their attention and be full of relatable content to connect to previous learning.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

        The fonts I've chosen are a mix between striking and calming. The headings are a font that isn't commonly seen.

        “Why do I have to learn math?” Website

This website is for a student that has complained to their teacher about learning math. Students may be here out of curiosity or compulsorily via assignment from their teacher. Common questions are: “Why do I have to learn this?”, “When will I ever use this?”, and “How does this help me?” Links to the other pages will be seen below:

Why:
If you’re an athlete, chances are you’ve been asked to spend some time in the weight room. Why? Is there any point in a game where someone throws 100 pounds of metal on your back and asks you to “get your legs parallel to the floor for two points!” Probably not.
The reason your coach wants you in the weight room is because those exercises strengthen the muscles used to succeed in sports. Math is the same. Higher forms of thinking are born from the neural connections created by solving the kinds of problems math presents.
When:
Unfortunately, even with significant math skills, we still can’t predict with 100% certainty everything in store for you over the next 70 years or so. Suffice it to say, most jobs that haven’t been replaced by computers or machines will ask you to perform some sort of problem solving. Top-paying careers right outside of college include: Actuaries (insurance risk analysts), Statisticians (people that come up with the numbers on sports/money), Data Scientists (people that look for trends in events to make them more efficient.) Financial literacy (being good with money) is a must for a successful person. It could also be the key to a successful business too if you’re planning on being a boss in the future. 
Although the silly “buy 43 watermelons for $3.14 a pound…” questions won’t occur too often; knowing how to use percentages, profits, budgeting, interest rates, salaries, benefits, etc will be greatly increased if you’re proficient in the basics of mathematics.
How:
What skills does a successful person have? Most interviews show that successful people believe they can do difficult things. They have excellent memories, they can think creatively, and can cope well with failure. All of these skills have been shown to be closely-tied with math competency. 
Once, I spoke to a septic tank cleaner (someone that cleans out all the solids that go down the toilet in areas outside of major cities.) He told me he was always told by his father, “people will value those who do what they can’t do, or what they don’t want to do.”
He took the “what they don’t want to do” route (and became a millionaire.) Math gives you the skills for what others can’t and won’t do.

      <h3>Game page-</h3>
      <p>
        Here we have links to games that are mathematical in nature, though not overtly so. Also 	there’s some links to mathematical skill support sites.

	Mastermind: 
A popular code-breaking game. The goal is to figure out the color-code by inputting a guess and looking at how many were in the right positions. This involves putting the known and unknown together in order to find a solution.

Logic Puzzles:
Once again, using what you do and don’t know to figure out what is possible and what is not. Read the facts to start off, then induct and deduct what must be true because of those facts. This involves filling out a chart in order to help you pin down the solutions.

KenKen:
Somewhat numerical, but also filling in what must and must not be true. The grid must include one of every number that can fit in the row/column with no repeats. The operations surrounded by the bold outlines must also come together to create the small number in the corner. These are easy at first but get difficult quickly. Great way to work on if-then thinking.

Khan Academy:
Get free videos and practice.

IXL:
Not free, but much better videos and feedback for individual questions.
